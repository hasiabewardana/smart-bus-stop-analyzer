**Assignment 3 - Group Project**  
**Date: June 2025**

## Abstract

Public transportation systems face significant challenges in managing passenger flow, detecting service disruptions, and optimizing bus schedules in real-time. This project presents a novel multi-stream online learning system that addresses these challenges by processing boarding, landing, and loader data streams simultaneously. Using CapyMOA's adaptive algorithms, our system performs real-time anomaly detection, predicts passenger flow for the next 30 minutes, and identifies network-wide patterns across multiple bus stops. The system achieved a prediction MAE of 3.2 passengers and successfully detected 94% of known anomalous events with a false positive rate below 5%. This solution enables proactive decision-making for bus operators and improves service reliability.

## 1. Introduction

Urban public transportation systems generate continuous streams of data that require real-time analysis for effective management. Traditional batch processing methods fail to capture the dynamic nature of passenger behavior and cannot provide timely insights for operational decisions. This project develops an innovative online learning system that processes multiple data streams to:

1. **Detect anomalies** in real-time that may indicate service disruptions, special events, or safety concerns
2. **Predict short-term passenger flow** to enable dynamic bus scheduling and capacity management  
3. **Identify network-wide patterns** to optimize route planning across multiple stops

Our solution leverages CapyMOA's state-of-the-art online learning algorithms to create an adaptive system that learns continuously from streaming data and adjusts to changing patterns.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Online Learning for Transportation

Recent advances in online learning have shown promising results for transportation applications. Adaptive Random Forest algorithms have demonstrated superior performance in handling concept drift in streaming environments (Gomes et al., 2017). Half-Space Trees provide efficient anomaly detection with constant memory requirements, making them suitable for real-time applications (Tan et al., 2011).

### 2.2 Passenger Flow Prediction

Traditional approaches to passenger flow prediction rely on historical averages or time-series models. However, these methods struggle with sudden changes in patterns. Online learning methods can adapt quickly to new patterns while maintaining predictive accuracy (Moreira-Matias et al., 2013).

### 2.3 Multi-Stream Processing

Processing multiple related data streams simultaneously presents unique challenges. Our approach builds on ensemble methods that can integrate information from multiple sources while maintaining computational efficiency (Bifet et al., 2018).

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

We formulate the problem as a multi-objective online learning task:

- **Input streams**: Boarding counts B(t), Landing counts L(t), Loader status D(t)
- **Outputs**: 
  - Anomaly score A(t) ∈ [0,1]
  - Passenger flow prediction P(t+k) for k ∈ {1,2,...,6} (5-minute intervals)
  - Pattern classification C(t) ∈ {normal, rush_hour, special_event, low_activity}

### 3.2 System Architecture

Our system consists of four main components:

1. **Feature Engineering Module**: Extracts temporal, statistical, and ratio-based features
2. **Anomaly Detection Module**: Uses Half-Space Trees for real-time anomaly scoring
3. **Prediction Module**: Adaptive Random Forest Regressor for flow forecasting
4. **Pattern Recognition Module**: Online Bagging classifier for pattern identification

15.    future_predictions.append(AdaptiveRF.predict(future_x))
16.  
17.  // Drift Detection

| 30 min | 5.8 | 8.4 | 0.76 |

The prediction accuracy decreases with longer horizons but remains useful for operational planning.

The system identified four main patterns:
- **Normal** (68%): Regular passenger flow
- **Rush Hour** (22%): Morning and evening peaks
- **Special Event** (7%): Unusual surges

### 6.2 Practical Implications

The system enables:
