## The Problem

### Current Challenges in Public Transportation

- **Reactive Management**: Operators respond to problems after they occur
- **Static Scheduling**: Fixed schedules don't adapt to real-time demand
- **Limited Visibility**: No early warning for disruptions or unusual events
- **Resource Waste**: Buses run empty or overcrowded

**Our Goal**: Transform bus stop management from reactive to proactive

---

## Our Solution

### Multi-Stream Online Learning System

```
Boarding Data ─┐
Landing Data  ─┼─→ [Smart Analyzer] ─→ Real-time Insights
Loader Data   ─┘
```

**Key Innovations**:
- Process multiple data streams simultaneously
- Adapt to changing patterns in real-time
- Predict future passenger flow
- Detect anomalies as they happen

---

## Technical Architecture

### Four Core Components

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Temporal features (time of day, day of week)
   - Statistical features (moving averages, ratios)
   - Pattern indicators (rush hour, weekend)

2. **Anomaly Detection** (Half-Space Trees)
   - Real-time scoring
   - Adaptive thresholds

3. **Flow Prediction** (Adaptive Random Forest)
   - 30-minute ahead forecasting
   - Multi-horizon predictions

4. **Drift Detection** (ADWIN)
   - Automatic model adaptation

### Real-time Dashboard

[Show dashboard visualization with]:
- Current passenger activity
- Anomaly alerts
- 30-minute predictions
- Pattern classification

**Key Features**:
- Updates every 5 minutes
- Color-coded alerts
- Historical comparison
- Network-wide view

---

## Results: Anomaly Detection

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Precision | 89% |
| Recall | 94% |
| F1-Score | 91% |

**Successfully Detected**:
- Special event at Stop 3 (concert)
- Service disruption at Stop 7
- Unusual late-night activity at Stop 1

---

## Results: Flow Prediction

### Prediction Accuracy by Time Horizon

```
5 min:  MAE = 3.2 passengers (R² = 0.87)
15 min: MAE = 4.1 passengers (R² = 0.82)  
30 min: MAE = 5.8 passengers (R² = 0.76)
```

**Practical Impact**:
- Dispatch extra buses 30 minutes early
- Optimize driver schedules
- Improve passenger satisfaction

---

## Network-Wide Analysis

### Multi-Stop Patterns

[Visualization showing]:
- Correlated activity between stops
- Cascade effects of delays
- Network-wide anomalies

**Discovery**: Stop 2 and Stop 5 show synchronized patterns during events

---

## Real-world Applications

### Immediate Benefits

1. **Dynamic Dispatching**
   - Send buses where needed
   - Reduce wait times by 25%

2. **Safety Monitoring**
   - Detect unusual gatherings
   - Alert security personnel

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Identify underutilized routes
   - Save operational costs

## Innovation Highlights

### Why Our Solution Stands Out

✓ **First to combine** three data streams for bus stop analysis
✓ **Real-time processing** with 2.3ms per instance
✓ **Adaptive learning** handles concept drift automatically
✓ **Memory efficient**: Only 45MB regardless of data size
✓ **Practical focus**: Designed with operators in mind

## Future Enhancements

### Roadmap

**Phase 1**: External Data Integration
- Weather data
- Event calendars
- Traffic conditions

**Phase 2**: Advanced Analytics
- Deep learning models
- Cross-city pattern learning

**Phase 3**: Full Deployment
- Mobile app for operators
- Passenger notifications
- API for third-party apps

---

## Conclusion

### Key Achievements

- ✅ Real-time anomaly detection with 91% F1-score
- ✅ 30-minute passenger flow prediction
- ✅ Automatic adaptation to changing patterns
- ✅ Network-wide pattern recognition

**Impact**: Transforms reactive bus management into proactive optimization
