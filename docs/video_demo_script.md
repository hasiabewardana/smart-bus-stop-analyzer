# Video Demo Script
## Smart Bus Stop Analyzer - COMPX523 Assignment 3

**Duration**: 1-2 minutes  
**Format**: Screen recording with narration

---

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00-0:10)
**Visual**: Title slide with project name and team members

**Narration**:
"Welcome to our Smart Bus Stop Analyzer demo. Our team has developed a real-time system that detects anomalies and predicts passenger flow for public transportation using CapyMOA's online learning algorithms."

---

### Scene 2: Problem Overview (0:10-0:20)
**Visual**: Dashboard showing live bus stop data with fluctuating passenger numbers

**Narration**:
"Bus operators currently react to problems after they occur. Our system processes boarding, landing, and loader data streams in real-time to provide early warnings and predictions."

---

### Scene 3: Live Processing Demo (0:20-0:40)
**Visual**: Jupyter notebook running, showing real-time data processing

**Narration**:
"Here's our system in action. As new data arrives every 5 minutes, we extract features, detect anomalies, and predict future passenger flow. Notice how the anomaly detector flags this unusual spike in passengers - this was actually a concert event."

**Action**: 
- Show data being processed
- Highlight anomaly detection (red alert)
- Show prediction updating

---

### Scene 4: Dashboard Visualization (0:40-0:55)
**Visual**: Real-time dashboard with four panels

**Narration**:
"Our dashboard provides operators with instant insights. The top-left shows actual versus predicted passenger flow. Top-right displays anomaly scores. Bottom panels show pattern distribution and 30-minute forecasts."

**Action**:
- Point to each panel
- Show anomaly alert appearing
- Highlight forecast bars

---

### Scene 5: Results Summary (0:55-1:10)
**Visual**: Performance metrics and graphs

**Narration**:
"Our system achieves 91% F1-score for anomaly detection and predicts passenger flow with only 3.2 passenger error for 5-minute predictions. It processes each instance in just 2.3 milliseconds."

---

### Scene 6: Conclusion (1:10-1:20)
**Visual**: Return to title slide with contact information

**Narration**:
"The Smart Bus Stop Analyzer transforms reactive bus management into proactive optimization. Thank you for watching. For more information, please see our full report."
